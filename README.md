# Valency
A Chemistry Memorisation Game Built in Unity.

This project was developed during the minimal spare time during VCE.
The game helps to memorise the numerous valency numbers of ions as part of the VCE curriculum. 
(This may no longer be the case as the ion set will not be updated from 2020).

# Unity
The app was built using unity version:
**m_EditorVersion:** 2019.3.6f1
**m_EditorVersionWithRevision:** 2019.3.6f1 (5c3fb0a11183)
